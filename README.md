# MS3 - Management Operating System

## Introduction
A "MOS" project is an meeting managemnt application. I is built based on one of the modules of "Digital Results Hub"(DRH) - a solution developed for a real consulting company. This module helps to digitise  Management Operatiing System (MOS) elements of operatioonal consulting methodology. A typical MOS consists of meetings, KPIs adn actions discussed during this meetings. MOS solution is a digital product that is normally installed at the client's site. It helps the client to improve meetings quality and manage productivity through standard process of looking at performance trends and defiining actions to address the variance between plananed and actual performance. 
The application is built for educational purposes only.

## User Experience (UX)
### GOALS
1. **For user** - the application will help a meeting chair to navigate thorugh KPIs Viusuals during the meeting, by using filters KPIs will be filtered by accountability. The performance of each participant will be visualised through Key Perrformance Indicators and those KPIs that require action effort will be conditionally highlighted. The visualisation will help to quickly identify the preformance level and address the variance with actions assigned to meeting participants.
2. **For Meeting participants** - the appliaction will help to understand through KPIs where they are expected to report to their meeting chair, suggest corrective actions, systematically follow up on actions and communicate actions completion during the meeting.
3. **For user with admin right** - the application will help the user with admin rihgths (secretary) to administer inputs for KPIs, inputs for actions, update actions statuses. That will be done prior to the meetings defined in applications
4. **For all the client's participants** - it will help to register and login to obtain an access to a set of performance indicators to manage department effectiveness and report performance throguh KPIs during the meeting. 
5. **For a developer** - the application is a simultaion of a real product that is currently in demand from industrial clients - large scale organisations with several levels of management. This app will help the developer to demosntrate the developer skills for potential emloyer that employ developer for consulting service. It can potentially be sold to his current employer who currently develops Digital Results HUb using other platforms (Azure, Powr Bi etc.)
